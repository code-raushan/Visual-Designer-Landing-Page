# Landing Page of a Visual Designer Agency made using pure HTML and CSS
>Hi everyone, I am Raushan and I made the landing page of a visual designer agency website using pure basics😎.

This project took 4 hours to complete and it was a nice learning experience. Got to know more about colors and fonts😀
And yes, it is completely responsive💻👍

Below is the link and preview of the webpage I made👇👇👇
